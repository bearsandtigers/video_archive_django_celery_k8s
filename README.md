This is a simple Django + Celery application once required as a test task by some employer. 

The task description was the following:

*Do develop a simple Django application including files to deploy*
(either Ansible or k8s configs, I chose the latter).
*uWSGI, Django, Celery, MariaDB, RabbitMQ should be used.*

*The application should provide a single page consisting of a web-form allowing to add some file and a list of previously added and processed files.
A file can be added either by direct upload using the form or by providing a link to the file. In the latter case the application should download a file using the provided link.
*
